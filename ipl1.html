    <h2>Back ground</h2>
    <p>The Indian Cricket League (ICL) was founded in 2007 with funding provided by Zee Entertainment Enterprises.[21]
        The ICL was not recognised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) or the International Cricket
        Council (ICC), and the BCCI was unhappy about its own committee members joining the ICL executive board.[22] To
        prevent players from joining the ICL, the BCCI increased the prize money associated with its domestic
        tournaments and imposed lifetime bans on any player joining the rival league, which the BCCI considered a rebel
        league</p>
    <h2>Foundation</h2>
    <p>On 13 September 2007,[25] following India's victory at the 2007 T20 World Cup,[26] the BCCI announced a
        franchise-based Twenty20 cricket (T20) competition called the Indian Premier League. The first season was
        scheduled to start in April 2008 in a "high-profile ceremony" at New Delhi. BCCI vice-president Lalit Modi, who
        led the IPL effort, provided details of the tournament, including its format, prize money, franchise revenue
        system, and squad composition rules. The new league, which would be run by a seven-man governing council, would
        also be the qualifying mechanism for that year's Champions League Twenty20.[25]

        To determine team ownership, an auction of franchises was held on 24 January 2008; the reserve prices of the
        eight franchises totalled $400 million,[24] although the auction raised a total of $723.59 million.[27] As a
        result of the ban imposed on players opting to participate in the ICL, the rival league closed down in 2009.</p>
    <h2>Organization</h2>
    <p>The IPL's headquarters is situated inside the Cricket Centre next to the Wankhede Stadium in Churchgate, Mumbai.
        The Governing Council is responsible for the league's functions, including tournament organisation. As of April
        2023, its members were</p>
    <h3>
        <li>Arun Singh Dhumal – Chairman</li>
    </h3>
    <h3>

    <H2>2013–2015: Initial years</H2>
    <p>Sunrisers Hyderabad made their IPL debut in the 2013 season.[4] They retained 20 players from the Chargers, which
        left slots open for 13 players (eight Indian, five overseas). They filled six of these with Thisara Perera,
        Darren Sammy, Sudeep Tyagi, Nathan McCullum, Quinton de Kock and Clint McKay. Kumar Sangakkara captained SRH for
        nine matches and Cameron White was captain for the remaining seven, as well as the eliminator match in the
        playoffs.[14] In their inaugural season, the team reached the playoffs but were eliminated after losing against
        Rajasthan Royals by 4 wickets at Feroz Shah Kotla in Delhi on 22 May 2013.[15] The team played all of their home
        games in Hyderabad.</p>
    <h2>2016–2020: Maiden title and consecutive playoff appearances</h2>
    <p>For the 2016 season, SRH retained 15 players and released nine.[25][26] After the auction, SRH traded two
        players.[27] Sunrisers Hyderabad were crowned champions after defeating Royal Challengers Bangalore in the final
        and ending the season with 11 wins and six losses. This was their maiden, and to date only, title. Bhuvneshwar
        Kumar became the first Sunrisers Hyderabad player to win the Purple Cap.</p>

        <h3>Winning Movement </h3>
    </center>
    <p>For the 2017 season, SRH retained 17 players and released six from the title-winning squad. The team then spent
        ₹45.1 crore (US$5.6 million) at the auction, leaving ₹20.9 crore (US$2.6 million) remaining.[28] As the
        defending champions, as per IPL norms, SRH hosted both the opening and closing ceremonies of the season. The
        team finished 3rd on points in the table. They lost against the Kolkata Knight Riders in the eliminator match at
        the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore. The team made a below-par total of 128–7 in 20 overs, but the Kolkata
        Knight Riders' innings was reduced to just six overs due to rain. The revised total was 48, which the Knight
        Riders met with seven wickets and four balls remaining. Bhuvneshwar Kumar was able to retain the Purple Cap[29]
        while David Warner won the Orange Cap</p>

    </center>
    <p>In September 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced the establishment of the Indian
        Premier League, a Twenty20 competition to be started in 2008.[5] In January 2008, the BCCI unveiled the owners
        of eight city-based franchises. The Chennai franchise was sold to the India Cements for $91 million, making it
        the fourth most expensive team in the league behind Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad.[6] India Cements acquired
        the rights to the franchise for 10 years. Former ICC Chairman N. Srinivasan was the de facto owner of the
        Chennai Super Kings, by means of his position as the vice-chairman and managing director of India Cements Ltd.
        The franchisee was transferred to a separate entity named Chennai Super Kings Cricket Ltd., after the Supreme
        Court of India struck down the controversial amendment to the BCCI constitution's clause 6.2.4 that allowed
        board officials to have a commercial interest in the IPL and the Champions League Twenty20 on 22 January 2015
    </p>
    <h3>2008–2009: First seasons</h3>
    <p>During the first player auctions for the inaugural IPL season conducted in January 2008, the Chennai franchise
        bought a number of contemporary star cricketers such as Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Matthew Hayden, Stephen Fleming,
        Muttiah Muralitharan and Michael Hussey.[8] Dhoni became the costliest player of the auction, as the Chennai
        franchise bought him for $1.5 million.[9] The franchise named Dhoni as the captain of the team and appointed
        Kepler Wessels as the head coach.[10] They played their first game on 19 April 2008 against Kings XI Punjab at
        Mohali. The Super Kings won the game by 33 runs after posting 240/5 in 20 overs, which was the highest total of
        the tournament, a record surpassed by themselves in 2010.[11] The Super Kings ended the league stage with eight
        wins from 14 games and finished third on the points table.[12] They beat the Kings XI Punjab by 9 wickets in the
        semifinal.[13] The Super Kings faced the Rajasthan Royals in the final of the IPL at Mumbai. Batting first, the
        Super Kings scored 163/5 in 20 overs and lost the game by 3 wickets off the final delivery of the match.[14]
        They also earned a spot in the inaugural Champions League Twenty20 along with Rajasthan, but the tournament was
        canceled due to the 2008 Mumbai attacks and the Super Kings, along with Rajasthan, received $5 million each as
        compensation.[15] Fleming, who had decided to retire from all forms of the game after the first season of the
        IPL, took over as the coach of the Super Kings team from Wessels for the next season which was to be held in
        South Africa.</p>

        <h3>Mumbai Indians</h3>
    </center>
    <p>Mumbai Indians won the 2011 Champions League Twenty20 after beating Royal Challengers Bangalore by 31 runs in the
        final. The team won the double by winning its first IPL title, in 2013, by defeating Chennai Super Kings by 23
        runs in the final, and then defeated the Rajasthan Royals by 33 runs to win its second Champions League Twenty20
        title later that year.[5][6] They won their second IPL title on 24 May 2015 by defeating the Chennai Super Kings
        by 41 runs in the final and became the third team to win more than one IPL title. On 21 May 2017, they won their
        third IPL title by defeating the Rising Pune Supergiant by 1 run in a thrilling final, thus becoming the first
        team to win three IPL titles.[7] While playing the tournament, they won their 100th T20, becoming the first team
        to do so. In 2019, they repeated the same feat as they won a record breaking fourth IPL title, by beating CSK by
        just 1 run on 12 May 2019 in the IPL Final. They became the first team to win the IPL title for the fifth time,
        by beating Delhi Capitals by 5 wickets on 10 November 2020 in the IPL Final.[8]</p>
    <h2>2008–2024:</h2>
    <p>In 2014, Mumbai Indians didn't start off well, losing 5 of their matches in the UAE leg against Kolkata Knight
        Riders, Royal Challengers Bangalore, Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Daredevils by big margins, but did well in
        their 5th match against Sunrisers Hyderabad, but consequently lost the matches against respective opponents.

        In the Indian leg, they made a comeback by beating Kings XI Punjab who were at the top of the table at that
        time. After that, they were inconsistent with their performance. They won against Royal Challengers Bangalore
        but lost against Chennai Super Kings. They won against the Sunrisers Hyderabad and again lost against Kolkata
        Knight Riders. But after losing against the Kolkata Knight Riders, they won against Kings XI Punjab and the
        Delhi Daredevils respectively.

        In the match against Kings XI Punjab, Lendl Simmons scored a hundred due to which they won comfortably by seven
        wickets.

        With one game left to play, they were fifth in the table with 12 points. In the last league-stage match of the
        season against Rajasthan Royals who were fourth in the league table with 14 points, they needed to win by a big
        margin so as to leapfrog the opponent into the fourth spot and claim the play-offs spot too. Rajasthan Royals
        set the target of 190 runs but Mumbai Indians had to reach the target in 14.3 overs in order to improve the net
        run rate and claim the fourth position in the table, but they just managed a tie with the Rajasthan Royals in
        14.3 overs. So, the Mumbai Indians needed a boundary off the next ball to push Rajasthan Royals below and claim
        that fourth spot, and Aditya Tare hit a six to a full toss bowled by James Faulkner. Due to that six, they
        reached the play-offs of IPL but lost against the Chennai Super Kings in the eliminator which ended their IPL
        2014 campaign.</p>
